# Timer
I implement this simple timer based on JavaScript SetTimeout method.
You can start the timer by clicking the 'START' button. you can also stop it for a while by clicking 'STOP' button, after that, you can continue your time counting. Clicking 'RESET' will clear the timer to zero.

I have tested it with Chrome and IE10, it works.

However, there are still some problems, if you stop it for too long. For example, you stop at 5:50, and restart the timer at 7:15, there would be problems. So, you'd better use a timer in production when need a timer to record something significant.
